Experiment: Compare 6conn with 24conn
Date: Jul 8, 2016

1) Run with density threshold off 
- too many final cubes are marked (64%); possibly caused by 4-adjacency expansion
- upThreshold: [6,0]

2) Run with density threshold off and 4-adjacancy off
- 4-adjacancy was off;
- still too many final cubes are marked (48%); possibly caused by low threshold not set
- upThreshold: [6, 0]

3) Run with density threshold off, 4-adjacancy off and set low threshold
- final cubes are marked (0.5%); 
- upThreshold: [12, 5]

III) Run with density threshold

IV) Run with density threshold & relaxation
